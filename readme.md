# A conversion calculator.

This is my first project. I just ran with whatever I thought of. It's definitely the first time I've made a parser.
I limited the dependencies to almost nothing so I can focus on learning instead of importing. The only folder that contains a "lot" of exteneral dependecies is the web folder.

The [web](/web) folder is used for displaying the calculator on a web page.

The [cli](/cli) folder is used for displaying the calculator on a terminal.

The [parser](/parser) folder is used for parsing strings and returning the value(s.)

The [conversion](/conversion) folder is used to contain the base conversion ratios.

The [text](/text) folder is used for parsing a string of text and checking if it contains specific units.
